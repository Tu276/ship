Maritime shipping is employed to move food, medicines, and far more at the heart of world
trade. For growth and development, economical mechanisms of shipping are followed,
particularly within the developing world. Machinery and equipment breakdown that occur
during marine transportation cause delays, swings in supplies, production, and trigger
infinite downstream effects on entire supply chains.

 In the shipping industry planned and
reactive maintenance that is primarily practiced requires halting of vessel operations for a
number of days despite the fact that no fatigue or machinery and equipment breakdown is
observed. Having seen the importance of motors that are widely utilized in ships auxiliary
machinery, the project focuses on creating failure predictions, additionally determining
remaining useful life (RUL) for motors aboard ships, albeit also quite fascinating is the
role this research plays in the monitoring of equipment on autonomous ships. This is
made possible with developments in information and technology. Massive amounts of
data is collected and can facilitate condition based monitoring (CBM), conduct analysis
on best performance and comprehensively diagnose ship engine room equipment.

Keywords: efficiency, condition monitoring, remaining useful life, autonomous ships, performance.
