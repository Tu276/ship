 The shipping industry is vital for the global economy, promoting trade, job growth, and resource accessibility. Despite sustainability challenges, it drives economic development and global connectivity. To ensure its positive impact, efforts to enhance sustainability and efficiency are crucial.
 
 Electric motors are pivotal in the shift to electric ship propulsion, offering environmental advantages, cost savings, and improved performance. As maritime sustainability gains priority, electric propulsion systems will shape the industry's future.
 
 This project focuses on characterizing and  predicting motor failures. It's particularly significant for autonomous ships,whose viability benefits from advancements in information technology. 
 
 We have collected extensive data, facilitating condition-based monitoring (CBM), performance analysis, and the development of a comprehensive diagnostics framework. This framework not only serves as a rapid indicator of the ship's reliability but, through the implementation of a comparative algorithm, allows us to accurately diagnose mechanical faults and identify anomalies. This integrated approach enhances our ability to proactively address potential issues and maintain optimal ship performance.
