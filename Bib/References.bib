	abstract = {Industry is constantly seeking ways to avoid corrective maintenance so as to reduce costs. Performing regular scheduled maintenance can help to mitigate this problem, but not necessarily in the most efficient way. In the context of condition-based maintenance, the main contributions of this work were to propose a methodology to treat and transform the collected data from a vibration system that simulated a motor and to build a dataset to train and test an Artificial Neural Network capable of predicting the future condition of the equipment, pointing out when a failure can happen. To achieve this goal, a device model was built to simulate typical motor vibrations, consisting of a computer cooler fan and several magnets. Measurements were made using an accelerometer, and the data were collected and processed to produce a structured dataset. The neural network training with this dataset converged quickly and stably, while the tests performed, k-fold cross-validation and model generalization, presented excellent performance. The same tests were performed with other machine learning techniques, to demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks mainly in their generalizability. The results of the work confirm that it is possible to use neural networks to perform predictive tasks in relation to the conditions of industrial equipment. This is an important area of study that helps to support the growth of smart industries.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which consist of miscellaneous sensors are used frequently in monitoring vital equipment. Benefiting from the development of data mining technologies, the massive data generated by sensors facilitate condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, too much data increase storage space, energy consumption, and computing resource, which can be considered fatal weaknesses for a WSN with limited resources. This study investigates a new method for motor bearings condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using the undersampled vibration signals acquired from a WSN. The proposed method, which is a fusion of the kurtogram, analog domain bandpass filtering, bandpass sampling, and demodulated resonance technique, can reduce the sampled data length while retaining the monitoring and diagnosis performance. A WSN prototype was designed, and simulations and experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Experimental results indicated that the sampled data length and transmission time of the proposed method result in a decrease of over 80\% in comparison with that of the traditional method. Therefore, the proposed method indicates potential applications on condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of motor bearings installed in remote areas, such as wind farms and offshore platforms.},

	title = {Predictive maintenance for ballast pumps on ship repair yards via machine learning},
	volume = {2},
	doi = {10.1016/j.treng.2020.100020},
	abstract = {Ballast pumps play a pivotal role in the operations of floating docks during docking and undocking of a marine vehicle that is due for inspection, repairs, or maintenance. Any failure of the ballast pumps during the docking/undocking operations may pose a threat to the safety of the dock crew, loss of revenue to the dock owners/operators, and disorganizes the schedules. Failure of the ballast pumps has been attributed to maintenance approaches used to predict such occurrences. This paper aims to provide a predictive maintenance approach towards an early warning maintenance/failure warning system using machine learning as opposed to sensor technology. A machine learning methodology was used to process and analyze the dock pump operating parameter with the aim of drawing inferences from data via MATLAB. Principal component analysis for the operating parameters was carried out to define which parameters will accurately predict the pump failure. Back pressure, flow rate, amperage, RPM and suction pressure, operating parameters, were monitored for 40 weeks. The predictive maintenance tool predicted that the dock pump may fail or requires maintenance between the 7th and 8th weeks. This prediction deviated from the actual 9 weeks and 2 days, that it took the dock pump to fail. A 13.85\% deviation from the actual failure time could be attributed to the quality and low volume of the operating data recorded. Nevertheless, with less ambiguity of the data, the maintenance prediction tool can be used as a basis before sensor technology on the dock pumps is implemented.},
