@article{Cheng:2018aa,
	abstract = {In industrial applications, nearly half the failures of motors are caused by the degradation of rolling element bearings (REBs). Therefore, accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for REBs are of crucial importance to ensure the reliability and safety of mechanical systems. To tackle this challenge, model-based approaches are often limited by the complexity of mathematical modeling. Conventional data-driven approaches, on the other hand, require massive efforts to extract the degradation features and construct health index. In this paper, a novel online data-driven framework is proposed to exploit the adoption of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in predicting the RUL of bearings. More concretely, the raw vibrations of training bearings are first processed using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and a novel nonlinear degradation indicator is constructed as the label for learning. The CNN is then employed to identify the hidden pattern between the extracted degradation indicator and the vibration of training bearings, which makes it possible to estimate the degradation of the test bearings automatically. Finally, testing bearings' RULs are predicted by using a $\epsilon$-support vector regression model. The superior performance of the proposed RUL estimation framework, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, is demonstrated through the experimental results. The generality of the proposed CNN model is also validated by transferring to bearings undergoing different operating conditions.},

@article{sampaio_prediction_2019,
	abstract = {Industry is constantly seeking ways to avoid corrective maintenance so as to reduce costs. Performing regular scheduled maintenance can help to mitigate this problem, but not necessarily in the most efficient way. In the context of condition-based maintenance, the main contributions of this work were to propose a methodology to treat and transform the collected data from a vibration system that simulated a motor and to build a dataset to train and test an Artificial Neural Network capable of predicting the future condition of the equipment, pointing out when a failure can happen. To achieve this goal, a device model was built to simulate typical motor vibrations, consisting of a computer cooler fan and several magnets. Measurements were made using an accelerometer, and the data were collected and processed to produce a structured dataset. The neural network training with this dataset converged quickly and stably, while the tests performed, k-fold cross-validation and model generalization, presented excellent performance. The same tests were performed with other machine learning techniques, to demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks mainly in their generalizability. The results of the work confirm that it is possible to use neural networks to perform predictive tasks in relation to the conditions of industrial equipment. This is an important area of study that helps to support the growth of smart industries.},

@article{lu_condition_2018,
	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which consist of miscellaneous sensors are used frequently in monitoring vital equipment. Benefiting from the development of data mining technologies, the massive data generated by sensors facilitate condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, too much data increase storage space, energy consumption, and computing resource, which can be considered fatal weaknesses for a WSN with limited resources. This study investigates a new method for motor bearings condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using the undersampled vibration signals acquired from a WSN. The proposed method, which is a fusion of the kurtogram, analog domain bandpass filtering, bandpass sampling, and demodulated resonance technique, can reduce the sampled data length while retaining the monitoring and diagnosis performance. A WSN prototype was designed, and simulations and experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Experimental results indicated that the sampled data length and transmission time of the proposed method result in a decrease of over 80\% in comparison with that of the traditional method. Therefore, the proposed method indicates potential applications on condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of motor bearings installed in remote areas, such as wind farms and offshore platforms.},

@article{kimera_predictive_2020,
	abstract = {Ballast pumps play a pivotal role in the operations of floating docks during docking and undocking of a marine vehicle that is due for inspection, repairs, or maintenance. Any failure of the ballast pumps during the docking/undocking operations may pose a threat to the safety of the dock crew, loss of revenue to the dock owners/operators, and disorganizes the schedules. Failure of the ballast pumps has been attributed to maintenance approaches used to predict such occurrences. This paper aims to provide a predictive maintenance approach towards an early warning maintenance/failure warning system using machine learning as opposed to sensor technology. A machine learning methodology was used to process and analyze the dock pump operating parameter with the aim of drawing inferences from data via MATLAB. Principal component analysis for the operating parameters was carried out to define which parameters will accurately predict the pump failure. Back pressure, flow rate, amperage, RPM and suction pressure, operating parameters, were monitored for 40 weeks. The predictive maintenance tool predicted that the dock pump may fail or requires maintenance between the 7th and 8th weeks. This prediction deviated from the actual 9 weeks and 2 days, that it took the dock pump to fail. A 13.85\% deviation from the actual failure time could be attributed to the quality and low volume of the operating data recorded. Nevertheless, with less ambiguity of the data, the maintenance prediction tool can be used as a basis before sensor technology on the dock pumps is implemented.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the extent of the currently achieved progress in autonomous and remotely controlled ships in the maritime sector. Major researches, statements from relevant sources and various anticipations on this subject are presented to outline a comprehensive scope of such progress. The engine room on conventional merchant ships is used as a viewpoint because it comprises numerous and complex systems. The main purpose of this paper is to establish a link between the levels of autonomy and the engine room with its associated systems on a conventional ship. At each level, the link should describe the relations between autonomy and the systems which are commonly found in the engine room on conventional ships. To create this link, comparison analysis uses the latest statements from the International Maritime Organization ({IMO}) and Classification Societies. Technical standards for autonomous and offshore vessels are derived from the guidelines provided by Classification Societies. Technical standards and requirements, related to the engine room of such ships, are individually described and compared to provide accurate and comprehensive scope of their current progress.},
